2. Segment Anything Task
   We take inspiration from NLP, where the next token pre-
diction task is used for foundation model pre-training and
to solve diverse downstream tasks via prompt engineer-
ing [10]. To build a foundation model for segmentation,
we aim to define a task with analogous capabilities.
Task. We start by translating the idea of a prompt from NLP
to segmentation, where a prompt can be a set of foreground
/ background points, a rough box or mask, free-form text,
or, in general, any information indicating what to segment
in an image. The promptable segmentation task, then, is to
return a valid segmentation mask given any prompt. The re-
quirement of a “valid” mask simply means that even when
a prompt is ambiguous and could refer to multiple objects
(e.g., recall the shirt vs. person example, and see Fig. 3),
the output should be a reasonable mask for at least one of
those objects. This requirement is similar to expecting a lan-
guage model to output a coherent response to an ambiguous
prompt. We choose this task because it leads to a natural
pre-training algorithm and a general method for zero-shot
transfer to downstream segmentation tasks via prompting.
                                                                      Figure 3: Each column shows 3 valid masks generated by

Figure 16: Zero-shot instance segmentation on LVIS v1. SAM produces higher quality masks than ViTDet. As a zero-shot
model, SAM does not have the opportunity to learn specific training data biases; see top-right as an example where SAM
makes a modal prediction, whereas the ground truth in LVIS is amodal given that mask annotations in LVIS have no holes.

D.4. Zero-Shot Instance Segmentation

Method. For zero-shot instance segmentation, we prompt
SAM with the boxes output by a fully-supervised ViTDet-H
on COCO and LVIS v1 validation splits. We apply an ad-
ditional mask refinement iteration by feeding the most con-
fident predicted mask, together with the box prompt, back
to the mask decoder to produce the final prediction. We
show zero-shot instance segmentations predicted on LVIS
in Fig. 16. Compared to ViTDet, SAM tends to produce
higher quality masks with cleaner boundaries. We confirm
this observation with human studies in §7.4. Note that as a
zero-shot model, SAM is not able to learn annotation biases           Figure 17: Visualization of thresholding the similarities of

Intended Use
         Primary intended uses    SAM is intended to be used for any prompt-based segmentation task. We explored its use in segmenting objects
                                  from a point (§7.1), edge detection (§7.2), segmenting all objects (§7.3), and segmenting detected objects (§7.4).
                                  We explored how SAM can integrate with other vision models to segment objects from text (§7.5).
         Primary intended users   SAM was primarily developed for research.                     The license for SAM can be found at
                                  https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.
         Out-of-scope use cases   See terms of use for SAM found at https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything. See Use Cases under
                                  Ethical Considerations.
  Caveats and recommendations     SAM has impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of tasks. We note, however, that in the zero-shot
                                  setting there may be multiple valid ground truth masks for a given input. We recommend users take this into
                                  consideration when using SAM for zero-shot segmentation. SAM can miss fine structures and can hallucinate
                                  small disconnected components. See §8 for a discussion of limitations.

Relevant Factors
                         Groups   SAM was designed to segment any object. This includes stuff and things.
Instrumentation and environment   We benchmarked SAM on a diverse set of datasets and found that SAM can handle a variety of visual data including
                                  simulations, paintings, underwater images, microscopy images, driving data, stereo images, fish-eye images. See
                                  §D.1 and Table 7 for information on the benchmarks used.

Metrics
  Model performance measures      We evaluated SAM on a variety of metrics based on the downstream task in our experiments.

                                      • mIoU: We used the mean intersection-over-union after a given number of prompts to evaluate the segmen-
                                        tation quality of a mask when prompted with points.
                                      • Human evaluation: We performed a human study (detailed in §E) to evaluate the real world performance
                                        of SAM. We compared the masks generated by SAM to a baseline state-of-the-art interactive segmentation
                                        model, RITM [92], using a perceptual quality scale from 1 to 10.
                                      • AP: We used average precision to evaluate instance segmentation for a given box and edge detection.
                                      • AR@1000: We used average recall to evaluate object proposal generation.
                                      • ODS, OIS, AP, R50: We used the standard edge detection evaluation metrics from BSDS500 [72, 3].

Ethical Considerations
                          Data    We trained SAM on licensed images. The images were filtered for objectionable content by the provider, but we
                                  acknowledge the possibility of false negatives. We performed a geographic analysis of the SA-1B dataset in §6.
                                  While SA-1B is more geographically diverse than many of its predecessors, we acknowledge that some geographic
                                  regions and economic groups are underrepresented.
    Cost and impact of compute    SAM was trained on 256 A100 GPUS for 68 hours. We acknowledge the environmental impact and cost of training
                                  large scale models. The environmental impact of training the released SAM model is approximately 6963 kWh
                                  resulting in an estimated 2.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide given the specific data center used, using the calculation
                                  described in [77] and the ML CO2 Impact calculator [61]. This is equivalent to ∼7k miles driven by the average
                                  gasoline-powered passenger vehicle in the US [101]. We released the SAM models to both reduce the need for
                                  retraining and lower the barrier to entry for large scale vision research.
                Risks and harms   We evaluated SAM for fairness in §6. Downstream use cases of SAM will create their own potential for biases
                                  and fairness concerns. As such we recommend users run their own fairness evaluation when using SAM for their
                                  specific use case.
                      Use cases   We implore users to use their best judgement for downstream use of the model.

We have several models that, when provided with a click or a box as input, output a mask. We would
like to compare the quality of these models by rating the quality of their masks on many examples.
The interface will be different than for regular mask annotation.
•       Each job reviews one mask in one image.
•       On the right, there will be five image thumbnails in two rows. Each thumbnail can be moused-
        over to show the image at a larger size. Clicking on the thumbnail will make it full screen, and
        clicking again will return to the original screen.
    –      The images show the same mask in five different views. On the top row: (left) the image
           without the mask, (middle) the mask overlaid on the image, and (right) the mask alone. On
           the bottom row: (left) a zoomed in view of the object without a mask, and (right) a zoomed
           in view of the mask overlaid on the image. These views are provided to make it easy to see
           different types of mask errors.
    –      The mask will be in red when overlaid on the image.
    –      When shown by itself, the mask is yellow, and the background is purple.
    –      Each image will include either a blue dot or a blue and white box. This is the input to the
           model, as if you had clicked at this location or drawn this box.
•       On the left, there are buttons labeled 1-10. This is used to rate the quality of the shown mask.
