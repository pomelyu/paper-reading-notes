                                                  in 3D space. Our architecture extracts 2D features from multiple camera images
                                                  and then uses a sparse set of 3D object queries to index into these 2D features,
                                                  linking 3D positions to multi-view images using camera transformation matrices.

                                                  Moreover, our method does not require post-processing such as non-maximum
                                                  suppression, dramatically improving inference speed. We achieve state-of-the-art
                                                  performance on the nuScenes autonomous driving benchmark.


                                         1   Introduction

                                         3D object detection from visual information is a long-standing challenge for low-cost autonomous
                                         driving systems. While object detection from point clouds collected using modalities like LiDAR
                                         benefits from information about the 3D structure of visible objects, the camera-based setting is even
                                         more ill-posed, since we must generate 3D bounding box predictions solely from the 2D information
                                         contained in RGB images.
                                         Existing methods [1, 2] typically build their detection pipelines purely from 2D computations. That
                                         is, they predict 3D information like object pose and velocity using an object detection pipeline de-
                                         signed for 2D tasks (e.g., CenterNet [1], FCOS [3]), without considering 3D scene structure or sensor
                                         configuration. These methods require several post-processing steps to fuse predictions across cam-
                                         eras and to remove redundant boxes, yielding a steep trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.
                                         As an alternative to these 2D-based methods, some methods incorporate more 3D computations
                                         into our object detection pipeline by applying a 3D reconstruction method like [4, 5, 6] to create a
                                         pseudo-LiDAR or range input of the scene from camera images. Then, they could apply 3D object
                                         detection methods to this data as if it were collected directly from a 3D sensor. This strategy, how-
                                         ever, is subject to compounding errors [7]: poorly-estimated depth values have a strongly negative
                                         effect on the performance of 3D object detection, which also can exhibit errors of its own.

                                             *: Equal contribution. ¶: Co-advise on the project.
In this paper, we propose a more graceful transition between 2D observations and 3D predictions for
autonomous driving, which does not rely on a module for dense depth prediction. Our framework,
termed DETR3D (Multi-View 3D Detection), addresses this problem in a top-down fashion. We link
2D feature extraction and 3D object prediction via geometric back-projection with camera transfor-
mation matrices. Our method starts from a sparse set of object priors, shared across the dataset
and learned end-to-end. To gather scene-specific information, we back-project a set of reference
points decoded from these object priors to each camera and fetch the corresponding image features
extracted by a ResNet backbone [8]. The features collected from the image features of the reference
points then interact with each other through a multi-head self-attention layer [9]. After a series of
self-attention layers, we read off bounding box parameters from every layer and use a set-to-set loss
inspired by DETR [10] to evaluate performance.
Our architecture does not perform point cloud reconstruction or explicit depth prediction from im-
ages, making it robust to errors in depth estimation. Moreover, our method does not require any
post-processing, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), improving efficiency and reducing re-
liance on hand-designed methods for cleaning its output. On the nuScenes dataset, our method
(without NMS) is comparable with prior art (with NMS). In the camera overlap regions, our method
significantly outperforms others.
Contributions. We summarize our key contributions as follows:
• We present a streamlined 3D object detection model from RGB images. Different from existing
  works that combine object predictions from the different camera views in a final stage, our method
  fuses information from all the camera views in each layer of computation. To the best of our
  knowledge, this is the first attempt to cast multi-camera detection as 3D set-to-set prediction.
• We introduce a module that connects 2D feature extraction and 3D bounding box prediction via
  backward geometric projection. It does not suffer from inaccurate depth predictions from a sec-
  ondary network, and seamlessly uses information from multiple cameras by back-projecting 3D
  information onto all available frames.
• Similarly to Object DGCNN [11], our method does not require post-processing such as per-image
  or global NMS, and it is on par with existing NMS-based methods. In the camera overlap regions,
  our method outperforms others by a substantial margin.
• We release our code to facilitate reproducibility and future research.

2   Related Work
2D object detection. RCNN [12] pioneered object detection using deep learning. It feeds a set
of pre-selected object proposals into a convolutional neural network (CNN) and predicts bounding
box parameters accordingly. Although this method exhibits surprising performance, it is an order of
magnitude slower than others because it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal.
To fix this issue, Fast RCNN [13] introduces a shared learnable CNN to process the entire image at a
single forward pass. To further improve performance and speed, Faster RCNN [13] includes a region
proposal network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network,
thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. Mask RCNN [14] incorporates a mask prediction
branch to enable instance segmentation in parallel. These methods typically involve multi-stage
refinements and can be slow in practice. Different from these multi-stage methods, SSD [15] and
YOLO [16] perform dense predictions in a single shot. Although they are significantly faster than
the alternatives above, they still rely on NMS to remove redundant box predictions. These methods
predict bounding boxes w.r.t. pre-defined anchors. CenterNet [1] and FCOS [3] change the paradigm
by shifting from per-anchor prediction to per-pixel prediction, significantly simplifying the common
object detection pipeline.
Set-based object detection. DETR [10] casts object detection as a set-to-set problem. It employs a
Transformer [9] to capture feature and object interactions. DETR learns to assign predictions to a set
of ground-truth boxes; thus, it does not require post-processing to filter out redundant boxes. One
critical drawback of DETR, however, is that it requires a significant amount of training time. De-
formable DETR [17] analyzes DETR’s slow convergence and proposes a deformable self-attention
module to localize features and accelerate training. Concurrently, [18] attributes the slow conver-
gence of DETR to the set-based loss and the Transformer cross attention mechanism. They pro-

CNN [19] incorporates set prediction into a RCNN-style pipeline; it outperforms multi-stage object

Object DGCNN [11] studies 3D object detection from point clouds. It models 3D object detection

Monocular 3D object detection. An early method for 3D detection from RGB images is
Mono3D [21], which uses semantic and shape cues to select from a collection of 3D proposals,
using scene constraints and additional priors at training time. [22] uses the birds-eye-view (BEV)
for monocular 3D detection, and [23] leverages 2D detections for 3D bounding box regression via
the minimization of 2D-3D projection error. The use of 2D detectors as a starting point for 3D
computation recently has become a standard approach [24, 25]. Other works also explore advances
in differentiable rendering [26] or 3D keypoint detection [27, 28, 1] to enable state-of-the-art 3D
object detection performance. All these methods operate in a monocular setting, and extensions to
multiple cameras are done by independently processing each frame before merging the outputs in a
post-processing stage.

3     Multi-view 3D Object Detection

3.1   Overview

Our architecture inputs RGB images collected from a set of cameras whose projection matrices (the
combination of intrinsics and relative extrinsics) are known, and it outputs a set of 3D bounding box
parameters for the objects in the scene. In contrast to past approaches, we build our architecture
based on a few high-level desiderata:

• We incorporate 3D information into intermediate computations within our architecture, rather than
  performing purely 2D computations in the image plane.
• We do not estimate dense 3D scene geometry, avoiding associated reconstruction errors.
• We avoid post-processing steps such as NMS.

We address these desiderata using a new set prediction module, which links 2D feature extrac-
tion and 3D box prediction by alternating between 2D and 3D computations. Our model contains
three critical components, illustrated in Figure 1. First, following common practice in 2D vision,
it extracts features from the camera images using a shared ResNet [8] backbone. Optionally, these
features are enhanced by a feature pyramid network (FPN) [29] (§3.2). Second, a detection head
(§3.3)—our main contribution—links the computed 2D features to a set of 3D bounding box predic-
tions in a geometry-aware manner (§3.3). Each layer of the detection head starts from a sparse set
of object queries, which are learned from the data. Each object query encodes a 3D location, which


                                                  3
is projected to the camera planes and used to collect image features via bilinear interpolation. Simi-
larly to DETR [10], we then use multi-head attention [9] to refine the object queries by incorporating
object interactions. This layer is repeated multiple times, alternating between feature sampling and
object query refinement. Finally, we evaluate a set-to-set loss [30, 10] to train the network (§3.4).

3.2   Feature Learning

Our model starts with a set of images I = {im1 , . . . , imK } ⊂ RHim ×Wim ×3 (captured by sur-
rounding cameras), camera matrices T = {T1 , . . . , TK } ⊂ R3×4 , ground-truth bounding boxes
B = {b1 , . . . , bj , . . . , bM } ⊂ R9 , and categorical labels C = {c1 , . . . , cj , . . . , cM } ⊂ Z. Each bj
contains position, size, heading angle, and velocity in the birds-eye view (BEV); our model aims to
predict these boxes and their labels from the these images. We do not use point clouds, which are
usually captured by high-end LiDAR.
These images are encoded with a ResNet [8] and a FPN [29] into four sets of features F1 , F2 , F3 , F4 .
Each set Fk = {f k1 , . . . , f k6 } ⊂ RH×W ×C corresponds to a level of features of the 6 images.
These multi-scale features provide rich information to recognize objects of different sizes. Next, we
detail our approach to transform these 2D features into 3D using a novel set prediction module.

3.3   Detection Head

Existing methods for detecting objects from camera input typically employ a bottom-up approach,
which predicts a dense set of bounding boxes per image, filters redundant boxes between the images,
and aggregates predictions across cameras in a post-processing step. This paradigm has two crucial
drawbacks: dense bounding box prediction requires accurate depth perception, which itself is a
challenging problem; and NMS-based redundancy removal and aggregation are non-parallelizable
operations that introduce significant inference overhead. We address these issues using a top-down
object detection head described below.
Analogously to [11, 17], DETR3D is iterative; it uses L layers with set-based computations to
produce bounding box estimates from 2D feature maps. Each layer includes the following steps:
1. predict a set of bounding box centers associated with object queries;
2. project these centers into all the feature maps using the camera transformation matrices;
3. sample features via bilinear interpolation and incorporate them into object queries; and
4. describe object interactions using multi-head attention.
Motivated by DETR [10], each layer ` ∈ {0, . . . , L − 1} operates on a set of object queries Q` =
{q `1 , . . . , q `M ∗ } ⊂ RC , producing a new set Q`+1 . A reference point c`i ∈ R3 is decoded from a
object query q `i as follows:
                                               c`i = Φref (q `i ),                                            (1)
         ref
where Φ is a neural network. c`i can be thought of a hypothesis for the center of the i-th box.
Next, we acquire image features corresponding to c`i to refine and predict the final bounding box.
Then, c`i (or more accurately its homogeneous counterpart c∗`i ) is projected into each one of the
images using the camera transformation matrices:
                                  c∗`i = c`i ⊕ 1             c`mi = Tm c∗`i ,                                 (2)
where ⊕ denotes concatenation, and c`mi is the projection of the reference point onto the m-th
camera. To remove the effects of the feature map size and gather features across different levels, we
normalize c`mi to [−1, 1]. Next, the images features are collected by
                                       f `kmi = f bilinear (Fkm , c`mi ),                                     (3)
where f `kmi is the feature for i-th point from k-th level of m-th camera at `-th layer.
A given reference point is not necessarily visible in all the camera images, so we need some heuris-
tics to filter invalid points. To that end, we define a binary value σ`kmi , which is determined based

We compute the loss for the predictions B̂` = {b̂`1 , . . . , b̂`j , . . . , b̂`M ∗ } ⊂ R9 and Cˆ` =
{ĉ`1 , . . . , ĉ`j , . . . , ĉ`M } ⊂ Z from every layer during training. During inference, we only use the
outputs from the last layer.

3.4   Loss

Following [30, 10], we use a set-to-set loss to measure the discrepancy between the prediction set
(B̂` , Cˆ` ) and the ground-truth set (B, C). This loss consists of two parts: a focal loss [31] for the
class labels and a L1 loss for the bounding box parameters. For notational convenience, we drop the
` subscript in B̂` and Cˆ` . The number of ground-truth boxes M is typically smaller than the number
of predictions M ∗ , so we pad the set of ground-truth boxes with ∅s (no object) up to M ∗ for ease of
computation. We establish a correspondence between the ground-truth and the prediction via a bi-
                                                 PM
partite matching problem: σ ∗ = arg minσ∈P j=1 −1{cj 6=∅} p̂σ(j) (cj ) + 1{cj =∅} Lbox (bj , b̂σ(j) ),
where P denotes the set of permutations, p̂σ(j) (cj ) is the probability of class cj for the prediction
with index σ(j), and Lbox is the L1 loss for bounding box parameters. We use the Hungarian
algorithm [32] to solve this assignment problem, as in [30, 10], yielding the set-to-set loss Lsup =
PN
   j=1 − log p̂σ ∗ (j) (cj ) + 1{cj =∅} Lbox (bj , b̂σ ∗ (j) ).


4     Experiments
We present our results as follows: first, we detail the dataset, metrics, and implementation in §4.1;
then we compare our method to existing works in §4.2; we benchmark the performance of different
models in camera overlap regions in §4.3; we compare to a forward prediction model in §4.4; and
we provide additional analysis and ablations in §4.5.

4.1   Implementation Details

Dataset. We test our method on the nuScenes dataset [33]. nuScenes consists of 1,000 se-
quences; each sequence is roughly 20s long, with a sampling rate of 20 frames/second. Each sam-
ple contains images from 6 cameras [front left, front, front right, back left, back,
back right]. Camera parameters including intrinsics and extrinsics are available. nuScenes pro-
vides annotations every 0.5s; in total there are 28k, 6k, and 6k annotated samples for training, vali-
dation, and testing, respectively. 10 from the total 23 classes are available to compute the metrics.
Metrics. We follow the official evaluation protocol provided by nuScenes. We evaluate average
translation error (ATE), average scale error (ASE), average orientation error (AOE), average velocity
error (AVE), and average attribute error (AAE). These metrics are true positive metrics (TP metrics)
and computed in the physical unit. In addition, we measure mean average precision (mAP). To
capture all aspects of the detection task, a consolidated scalar metric–the nuScenes Detection Score
                                     1
                                                  P
(NDS) [33]–is defined as NDS = 10      [5mAP + mTP∈TP (1 − min(1, mTP))].
Model. Our model consists of a ResNet [8] feature extractor, a FPN, and a DETR3D detection head.
We use ResNet101 with deformable convolutions [34] in the 3rd stage and 4th stage. The FPN [29]
takes features output by the ResNet and produces 4 feature maps whose sizes are 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and
1/64 of the input image sizes. The DETR3D detection head consists of 6 layers, where each layer is a
combination of a feature refinement step and a multi-head attention layer. The hidden dimension of
the DETR3D detection head is 256. Finally, two sub-networks predict bounding box parameters and
a class label per object query; each sub-network consists of two fully connected layers with hidden
dimensions 256. We use LayerNorm [35] in the detection head.
Training & inference. We use AdamW [36] to train the whole pipeline. The weight decay is 10−4 .
We use an initial learning rate 10−4 , which is decreased to 10−5 and 10−6 at 8th and 11th epochs.
The model is trained for 12 epochs in total on 8 RTX 3090 GPUs and the per-GPU batch size is 1.

The training procedure takes roughly 18 hours. We do not use any post-processing such as NMS
during inference. For evaluation, we use the nuScenes evalutation toolkit.


4.2   Comparison to Existing Works

We compare to previous state-of-the-art methods CenterNet [1] and FCOS3D [2]. CenterNet is an
anchor-free 2D detection method that makes dense predictions in a high resolution feature map.
FCOS3D employs a FCOS [3] pipeline to make per-pixel predictions. These methods both turn 3D
object detection into a 2D problem, and in doing so ignore scene geometry and sensor configuration.
To perform multi-view object detection, these methods have to process each image independently,
and use both per-image and global NMS to remove redundant boxes in each view and in the overlap
regions respectively. As shown in Table 1, our method outperforms these methods even though
we do not use any post-processing. Our method performs worse than FCOS3D in terms of mATE.
We suspect this is because FCOS3D directly predicts bounding box depth, which leads to strong
supervision on object translation. Also, FCOS3D uses disentangled heads for different bounding
box parameters, which can increase performance.
On the test set (Table 2), our method outperforms all existing methods as of 10/13/2021; our method
uses the same backbone as DD3D [37] for a fair comparison.


4.3   Comparison in Overlap Regions

A great challenge lies in the overlap regions where objects are more likely to be cut off. Our method
considers all cameras simultaneously, while FCOS3D predicts bounding boxes per camera individ-
ually. To further demonstrate the advantages of fused inference, we calculate the metrics for boxes
falling into the camera overlaps. To compute the metrics, we select boxes whose 3D center is visible
to multiple cameras. On the validation set, there are 18,147 such boxes, 9.7% of the total. Table 3
shows the results; our method outperforms FCOS3D remarkably in terms of NDS scores in this
setting. This confirms that our integrated prediction approach is more effective.

4.4    Comparison to pseudo-LiDAR Methods

Another way to perform 3D object detection is by generating pseudo-LiDAR point clouds from
multi-view images using a depth prediction model. On the nuScenes dataset, there are no publicly
available pseudo-LiDAR works for us to make a direct comparison. Hence, we implement a base-
line ourselves to verify that our approach is more effective than explicit depth prediction. We use
a pre-trained PackNet [6] network to predict dense depth maps from all six cameras and then con-
vert these depth maps into point clouds using the camera transformations. We also experimented
with a self-supervised PackNet model with velocity supervision (as in the original paper), but we
found that ground-truth depth supervision yielded more realistic point clouds and therefore used a
supervised model as baseline. For 3D detection, we employ the recently-proposed CenterPoint ar-
chitecture [41]. Conceptually, this pipeline is a variant of pseudo-LiDAR [42]. Table 4 shows the
results; we conclude that this pseudo-LiDAR method underperforms ours significantly even when
depth estimates are generated by a state-of-the-art model. One possible explanation is that pseudo-
LiDAR object detectors suffer from compounding errors introduced by inaccurate depth prediction,
that in turn is known to overfit to training data and generalizes poorly to other distributions [7].

4.5    Ablation & Analysis

We provide a visualization of object query refinement in Figure 2. We visualize bounding boxes
decoded from the object queries in each layer. The predicted bounding boxes get closer to the
ground-truth as we go into deeper layers in the model.Also, the leftmost figure shows the learned
object query priors shared by all data. We also provide quantitative results in Table 5, which shows
that iterative refinement indeed improves performance significantly. This suggests that iterative
refinement is both beneficial and necessary to fully leverage our proposed architecture. Furthermore,
we provide ablations on the number of object queries in Table 6; increasing the number queries
consistently improves the performance until it gets saturated at 900. Finally, Table 7 shows the
results with different backbones.
We also provide qualitative results in Figure 3 to facilitate an intuitive understanding of model per-
formance. We project the predicted bounding boxes into 6 cameras as well as a BEV perspective. In
general, our method generates reasonable results and even detects relatively small objects. However,
our method still exhibits substantial translation error (in line with results in Table 4.2): Although our
model avoids explicit depth prediction, depth estimation is still a core challenging in this problem.

5     Conclusion
We propose a new paradigm to address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering 3D information
from 2D images. In this setting, the input signal lacks essential information for models to make
effective predictions without priors learned from data. While other methods either operate solely on

2D computations or use additional depth networks to reconstruct the scene, ours operates in 3D space
and uses backward projection to retrieve image features as needed. The benefits of our approach are
two-fold: (1) it eliminates the need for middle-level representations (e.g., predicted depth maps
or point clouds), which can be a source of compounding errors; and (2) it uses information from
multiple cameras by projecting the same 3D point onto all available frames.
Beyond the direct application of our work to 3D object detection for autonomous driving, there
are several venues that warrant future investigation. For example, single point projection creates a
limited receptive field in the retrieved image feature maps, and sampling multiple points for each
object query would incorporate more information for object refinement. Furthermore, the new detec-
tion head is input-agnostic, and including other modalities such as LiDAR/RADAR would enhance
performance and robustness. Finally, generalizing our pipeline to other domains such as indoor nav-
igation and object manipulation would increase its scope of application and reveal additional ways
for further improvement.
