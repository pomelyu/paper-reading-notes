A. Related Work
A.1. LLM Inference Acceleration
The inefficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference is primarily attributed to the memory-bandwidth-bound nature
of the auto-regressive decoding process. Several methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue, improving inference
latency and throughput. Traditionally, batch inference has been employed as a straightforward method to enhance arithmetic
intensity and escape memory-bandwidth-bound limitations. However, with LLMs, both model parameters and the Key-Value
(KV) cache consume substantial accelerator memory, hindering the utilization of large batch sizes. Existing methods to
tackle this problem can be conceptually divided into two main categories: (1) Reducing memory consumption, thereby
minimizing memory transfer overhead and enabling larger batch sizes, and (2) Minimizing the number of decoding steps to
decrease latency directly.

Reducing KV Cache. Methods such as Multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019) and Grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al.,
2023) adopt a direct approach to diminish the KV cache. By utilizing fewer key and value heads in the attention modules
relative to query heads, these strategies substantially cut the KV’s memory consumption, thereby facilitating larger batch
sizes and enhanced accelerator utilization (Pope et al., 2022). Additionally, Zhang et al. (2023) proposes to selectively retain
the most critical KV tokens, further reducing the KV cache. From a system perspective, Kwon et al. (2023) introduces a
paged memory management scheme for reducing fragmentation of the KV cache.

Quantization. Quantization techniques are extensively used to shrink LLMs’ memory consumption. Xiao et al. (2023a)
apply rescaling between activations and parameters to eliminate outliers and simplify the quantization process. Dettmers
et al. (2022) breaks down matrix multiplications into predominantly 8-bit and a minority of 16-bit operations. Frantar
et al. (2022) iteratively round weight columns into 3/4 bits, while Lin et al. (2023) present an activation-aware quantization
scheme to protect salient weights and compress LLMs to 3/4 bits. Kim et al. (2023) introduce a sparse plus low-precision
pattern to handle a minor portion of vital weights, among other techniques.

Speculative Decoding. As an approach orthogonal to the aforementioned methods, speculative decoding (Leviathan et al.,
2022; Chen et al., 2023) aims to execute several decoding steps in parallel, thus reducing the total number of steps required.
This parallelization is realized by employing a smaller draft model to conjecture several subsequent words, which the LLMs
then collectively evaluate and accept as appropriate. While resonating with non-autoregressive generation literature (Xiao
et al., 2023b), this method is specifically tailored for LLMs to address the aforementioned inefficiency. Unlike previous
works, we propose leveraging the original model to make predictions rather than introducing an additional draft model. This
approach is more straightforward and seamlessly integrates into existing systems without the complexities of managing two
models. Independently, Miao et al. (2023); Spector & Re (2023) propose the use of tree-structured attention to generate
multiple candidates in parallel, where Miao et al. (2023) suggest employing an ensemble of models to propose candidates,
and Spector & Re (2023) advocate adding another hierarchy for the draft model. However, draft models require specialized
pretraining and alignment with the target models. While employing multiple draft models can be cumbersome and involves
the complexity of managing parallelism, our approach, which relies solely on decoding heads, offers a simpler alternative.
Miao et al. (2023) employ multiple draft models to generate tokens and merge them using tree attention, while Spector &
Re (2023) utilize a small draft model to process each level of the tree in batches. In contrast, our method directly uses the
top predicted tokens from each of M EDUSA heads to create a static sparse tree without autoregression or adjusting the tree
structure. This approach simplifies the process and improves efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate through a detailed
ablation study how the nodes of the tree can affect decoding speed.

A.2. Sampling Scheme
The manner in which text is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly influence the quality of the
generated output. Recent studies have revealed that direct sampling from a language model may lead to incoherent or
nonsensical results (Pillutla et al., 2021; Holtzman et al., 2020). In response to this challenge, truncation sampling schemes
have been introduced (Fan et al., 2018; Basu et al., 2021; Meister et al., 2022; Hewitt et al., 2022; Meister et al., 2023).
These approaches aim to produce high-quality and diverse samples by performing sampling on a truncated distribution over
a specific allowed set at each decoding step.
Different strategies define this allowed set in various ways. For example, top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018) retains the k
most likely words, whereas top-p sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) incorporates the minimal set of words that account for p

                                                              13

percent of the probability. Another method, known as typical decoding (Meister et al., 2023), employs the entropy of the
predicted distribution to establish the threshold for inclusion. Hewitt et al. (2022) offers a unified framework to understand
truncation sampling techniques comprehensively.
Drawing inspiration from these methods, our typical acceptance scheme aligns with the concept of defining an allowed set
to exclude improbable candidates from the sampling process. However, we diverge because we do not insist on an exact
correspondence between the output and language model distribution. This deviation allows us to facilitate more diverse yet
high-quality outputs, achieving greater efficiency without compromising the integrity of the generated text.

B. Experiment Settings
B.1. Common Terms
We clarify three commonly used terms: a) Acceleration rate: This refers to the average number of tokens decoded per
decoding step. In a standard auto-regressive model, this rate is 1.0. b) Overhead: This is used to characterize the per
decoding step overhead compared to classic decoding, and is calculated by dividing the average per step latency of the
M EDUSA models by that of the vanilla model. c) Speedup: This refers to the wall-time acceleration rate. Following these
definitions, we have the relation: Speedup = Acceleration rate / Overhead.

B.2. Shared Settings
For all the experiments, we use the Axolotl (Axolotl, 2023) framework for training. We use a cosine learning rate scheduler
with warmup and use 8-bit AdamW (Dettmers et al., 2021) optimizer. We train 5 M EDUSA heads with 1 layer and set λk in
Eq. (1) to be 0.8k . For M EDUSA-2, we use either LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) or QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023) for fine-tuning
and set the learning rate of M EDUSA heads to be 4 times larger than the backbone model. LoRA is applied to all the linear
layers of the backbone model, including the language model head. The rank of LoRA adapter is set to 32, and α is set to 16.
A dropout of 0.05 is added to the LoRA adapter.

B.3. M EDUSA-1 v.s. M EDUSA-2 on Vicuna 7B and 13B
We use a global batch size of 64 and a peak learning rate of 5e−4 for the backbone and 2e−3 for M EDUSA heads and
warmup for 40 steps. We use 4-bit quantized backbone models for both models. We first train the models with M EDUSA-1
and use these trained models as initialization to train M EDUSA-2. We employ QLoRA for M EDUSA-2 and the λ0 in Eq. (2)
is set to be 0.2.

B.4. Training with Self-Distillation on Vicuna-33B and Zephyr-7B
We use M EDUSA-2 for both models instead of using a two-stage training procedure. We use a sine schedule for the θ0 to
gradually increase the value to its peak at the end of the training. We find this approach is equally effective. We set the
peak learning rate of the backbone LoRA adapter to be 1e−4 and the warmup steps to be 20 since the self-distillation loss is
relatively small. We set the λ0 in Eq. (2) to be 0.01.

C. Visualization of optimized tree attention
Fig. 6 illustrates the structure of a sparsely constructed tree for the M EDUSA-2 Vicuna-7B model. This tree structure extends
four levels deep, indicating the engagement of four M EDUSA heads in the computation. The tree is initially formed through a
Cartesian product approach and subsequently refined by pruning based on the statistical expectations of the top-k predictions
from each M EDUSA head measured on the Alpaca-eval dataset (Dubois et al., 2023). The tree’s lean towards the left visually
represents the algorithm’s preference for nodes with higher probabilities on each head.

D. Results of Speculative Decoding
In this study, speculative decoding was applied to Vicuna models (Chiang et al., 2023) with varying sizes, specifically 7B,
13B, and 33B. The preliminary framework utilized open-source models such as Llama-68M and 160M (Miao et al., 2023),

et al., 2022), open-source alternatives3 were deployed for evaluation. Additionally, we utilize torch.compile() to
accelerate the inference speed of draft models.
Our results shown in Fig. 7, reveal that the optimal settings of the draft model vary with the Vicuna model sizes. Specifically,
the Llama-68M, with a setting of the draft token number γ = 4, yielded the best performance for Vicuna-7B, while the same
draft model with γ = 3 was most effective for Vicuna-13B. For the larger Vicuna-33B, the Tiny-Vicuna (Vicuna-1B), with
γ = 3, provided the greatest acceleration. These results suggest that the choice and setting of the drafting model should be
tailored to the size of the LLMs, presenting an area for further exploration in the field.

G. Exploration and Modeling of Hardware Constraints and M EDUSA


We explore the hardware constraints, specifically memory-bandwidth bound, and their impact on M EDUSA-style parallel
decoding by incorporating a simplified Llama-series model. First, we identify that the operators involving matrix multi-
plications, such as linear layers and attention matrix multiplications, are the primary sources of overhead. We profile the
performance of FLOP/s vs. Operational Intensity which is the ratio of FLOP/s to bandwidth (bytes/s), across various GPUs,
including the A100-80GB-PCIe, A40, and A6000. Next, we examine the changes in FLOP/s vs. Operational Intensity when
using M EDUSA for different operators. Finally, we apply a straightforward analytical model to calculate acceleration rates
and combine it with hardware benchmarks. This provides insights into the effects under different model sizes, sequence
lengths, and batch sizes.

G.1. Roofline Model of Operators
We present an analysis of the roofline model for various operators in large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing
on Llama-7B, Llama-13B, and Llama-33B (Touvron et al., 2023). These models were benchmarked on different GPUs,
including the A100-80GB-PCIe, A40, and A6000. We looked into the three categories of matrix multiplication operators
since they represent the primary sources of computational overhead in these models. Our study follows the report (Chen,
2023) which investigates the effectiveness of batch size but ours focuses more on decoding and parallel decoding.
Table 5 details the computation and space complexity for each operator during the prefill, decoding, and M EDUSA decoding
phases. The operators include the linear layers for query, key, and value matrices (XWQ , XWK , XWV ), the attention
matrix multiplications (QK T , P V ), and the up/gate/down linear layers (XWu , XWg , XWd ). b stands for the batch size, s
stands for the sequence length, h stands for the hidden dimension, i stands for the intermediate dimension, n stands for the
number of attention heads, d stands for the head dimension and q stands for the candidate length for M EDUSA. For more
details of these operators please refer to the articles (Touvron et al., 2023; Chen, 2023).
Figures 9-17 show the benchmark of three categories of operators on different models (7/13/33B) under various settings. To
evaluate each operator’s performance and throughput, we chose the combination of settings including batch sizes from 1 to

64 in powers of 2 and sequence lengths from 128 to 8192 in powers of 2 (49 settings for each operator). From all the figures,
we observe that the datapoints of each operator in the prefill and decoding stages cluster at very similar positions across all
GPUs and for various model sizes.
During the prefill phase, increasing the batch size changes the FLOP/s of the attention matrix multiplications (see ‘qk/pv
init‘) but does not affect the Operational Intensity (refer to the vertical dashed arrow in Fig. 9). In contrast, increasing
the sequence length impacts both FLOP/s and Operational Intensity in the prefill phase (refer to the diagonal dashed arrow
in Fig. 9). During the decoding phase, the attention matrix multiplications are significantly limited by memory bandwidth.
Despite an increase in FLOP/s with changes in batch size and sequence length, the Operational Intensity remains nearly
unchanged (see ‘qk/pv ar‘). This indicates suboptimal resource utilization in the self-attention mechanism.
The linear layers in the prefill phase are mostly compute-bound (see ‘qkv mlp init‘ and ‘up/gate/down init‘).
During the decoding phase, the datapoints of the linear layer form a line with the same slope as the GPU’s memory
bandwidth (see ‘qkv mlp ar‘ and ‘up/gate/down ar‘). This indicates the linear layers in the decoding stage are
also bounded by memory bandwidth. Increasing the batch size improves the achieved FLOP/s and Operational Intensity
under memory bandwidth constraints through better parallelism. Note that linear layers only process the new token and are
independent of sequence length (See ‘Decoding‘ section in Table 5).

Figure 9. The figure shows the relationship between FLOP/s and Operational Intensity for all benchmarked datapoints of Llama-7B
operators on A100-80GB-PCIe. The dashed lines represent the HBM bandwidth limit (1,935GB/s) and the peak performance limit (312
TFLOP/s) (NVIDIA). ‘qkv mlp’ stands for the linear layers projecting hidden features to query/key/value features. ‘up/gate/down’
stands for the linear layers following the attention block. ‘qk/pv’ stands for the two steps of attention matrix multiplications. ‘ar’ stands
for the decoding (autoregressive) and ‘init’ stands for the prefill phase.

G.2. FLOP/s vs. Operational Intensity Variations in M EDUSA
We investigate how Medusa can change Operational Intensity and elevate the FLOP/s. We choose Llama 33B on A100-
80GB-PCIe as the setting.
First, we examine the attention matrix multiplication. Fig. 18 and Table 6 illustrate the effects of M EDUSA while keeping the
batch size fixed at 16. We observe increased FLOP/s and Operational Intensity as more candidate tokens are added (original
decoding results are plotted as grey dots). This indicates that M EDUSA can leverage additional candidate tokens to improve
computational throughput. Compared to regular decoding, M EDUSA achieves 44× FLOP/s and 41× Operational Intensity
under the setting of batch size 16 and sequence length 1024 with 64 candidate tokens. Fig. 19 and Table 7 illustrate the
effects of M EDUSA decoding while keeping the sequence length fixed at 1024. Increasing the batch size does not improve
Operational Intensity in this scenario.
Next, we examine the linear layer, focusing on the up/gate/down linear layers. The results are shown in Fig. 20 and
Table 8. Since the linear layers in the decoding phase only process the future tokens while the past tokens are cached,
they are independent of the sequence length. We vary the batch size to observe the effects. As M EDUSA increases the
number of candidate tokens with the increasing batch size, we observe a shift from a memory-bandwidth-bound region to a
computation-bound region. This shift demonstrates how M EDUSA can transition the performance characteristics of the
linear layers from being limited by memory bandwidth to being limited by computational capacity.

G.3. Predicting M EDUSA Performance
We further employ a straightforward analytical model for the acceleration rate. The ablation study results in Sec. 3.3.1
indicate that the acceleration rate can be approximated by a simple logarithmic function. Using the results from Fig. 4a,
we model the curve as acc rate = 0.477 log(num candidate). We simulate the latency of one simplified block of
the Llama-7B model (sequentially processing XWQ , XWK , XWV , QK T , P V , XWu , XWg , XWd ) by first fixing the
batch size at 1 and the sequence length at 1024. The candidate tokens are processed parallelly by constructing the tree
attention described in Section 2.1.2. We omit the latency of the post-processing steps including verification and acceptance
for M EDUSA since they introduce marginal overhead. Fig. 21 illustrates the simulated acceleration rate and speedup
for different numbers of candidate tokens under these settings. As the number of candidate tokens increases, both the
acceleration rate and speedup initially show improvements. However, beyond 64, the speedup starts to decline, indicating
diminishing returns with further increases in candidate length. This aligns with the experimental results in Fig. 4b and
suggests that there is an optimal range for the numbers of candidate tokens where M EDUSA provides the most significant
performance gains.
We plot the simulated speedup under different batch size settings with a fixed sequence length of 1024 in Fig. 22. The
results indicate that when the batch size exceeds 32, the speedup decreases and may even have a negative effect. This occurs
because the linear layers shift from being memory-bandwidth-bound to computationally bound.
We conduct another experiment using a batch size of 4 and different sequence lengths. As shown in Fig. 23, the optimal
number of candidate tokens remains relatively consistent across different sequence lengths. However, as the sequence length
increases, the overall performance decreases. This performance drop is primarily due to the overhead from attention matrix
multiplication, while the linear layer computation remains constant since the computation of linear layers is independent of
the sequence length.

                                                                                                25
                             M EDUSA: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads

Our simulations show that the optimal number of candidate tokens is key for model scaling with M EDUSA, as benefits
decrease beyond a certain range. Initially, increasing batch size improves performance through parallelism, but too large a
batch size shifts linear layers from memory-bandwidth-bound to compute-bound, reducing speedup. Longer sequences
increase attention matrix multiplication overhead, lowering performance, and emphasizing the need to optimize attention
mechanisms. Effective model scaling requires balancing the number of candidate tokens, adjusting batch sizes to avoid
compute-bound transitions, and enhancing attention mechanisms for longer sequences. These strategies ensure better
resource utilization and higher performance, demonstrating the value of simulations in predicting performance and guiding
acceleration strategy design.
