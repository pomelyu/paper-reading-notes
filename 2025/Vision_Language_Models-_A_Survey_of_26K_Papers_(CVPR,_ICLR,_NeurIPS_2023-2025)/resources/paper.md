                                                    We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted pa-
                                                pers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023–2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-
                                                protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-
                                                grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modal-
                                                ities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision–language–LLM
                                                work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning;
                                                (2) steady expansion of generative methods—with diffusion research consolidating around controllability,
                                                distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to
                                                Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
                                                parameter-efficient adaptation (prompting, adapters/LoRA) and lightweight vision–language bridges
                                                dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and fine-
                                                tuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation.
                                                Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR’s stronger 3D footprint and ICLR’s highest VLM share, while
                                                reliability themes (efficiency, robustness) diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology
                                                to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the
                                                longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.


                                         1      Introduction
                                         The computer-vision and machine-learning community has undergone a visible transition in 2023–2025. With
                                         the consolidation of large-scale pretrained models (CLIP/BLIP/LLaVA [1, 2, 3] families, ViT backbones) and
                                         ubiquitous diffusion-based generators, the research focus has shifted: classic perception remains active, yet a
                                         large fraction of accepted papers are now organized around multimodal training, general-purpose reasoning
                                         or generation, and efficiency. While many reports provide anecdotal evidence, our goal is to quantify this
                                         transition from primary sources: the official titles and abstracts of accepted papers at CVPR, ICLR, and
                                         NeurIPS.


                                         2      Data and Methodology
                                         Data: We ingest all JSONL files collected by our Python spider: CVPR (2023: 2,353 papers; 2024: 2,713;
                                         2025: 2,871), ICLR (2023: 4,372; 2024: 2,260; 2025: 3,704), and NeurIPS (2023: 3,337; 2024: 4,494). After
                                         removing empty records, 26,104 abstracts remain for analysis. In addition, for trend analysis only, we also
                                         include 8,424 papers from 2022; these 2022 records are used solely to study longitudinal trends and are
                                         excluded from content analysis, which focuses on the most recent three years.
                                         Text processing: We normalize Unicode, lowercase, strip punctuation, protect multi-word phrases (e.g.,

“gaussian splatting”, “neural radiance fields”, “vision language model”) as single tokens, and remove general
stopwords and generic CV terms to retain the technical content.
Labeling: Each abstract is matched against 35 regular-expression categories (Diffusion, Vision-Language/LLM,
3D, Video, Robustness, Efficiency, etc.). A paper can receive multiple labels. We then compute prevalence
as the fraction of abstracts in a year that match the label.
Fine-grained mining: For selected areas we search for sub-topics: tasks (e.g., grounding), architecture mo-
tifs (e.g., LoRA/adapters), training regimes (pretrain+fine-tune, instruction tuning), representative losses,
and named datasets.
Caveat: The approach is transparent and replicable, but lexicon-driven—precision is high for canonical
phrases; recall may miss niche synonyms; all numbers refer to abstracts only.


3    Macro Trends
Fig 1 summarizes the fraction of papers per year tagged as VLM/LLM, diffusion, 3D (NeRF/Gaussian +
geometry), and video understanding et al. The rise of VLM is unmistakable: from 16% (2023) to 40% (2025)
of all abstracts we analyzed. By 2025, the VLM share reaches 39.5% at CVPR and 40.7% at ICLR. Diffusion
expands in parallel (8%→14.9%→19.2%), while classic 3D remains stable overall with composition shifting
from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting. Video has a steady incline, partly due to video-LLMs and long-context
modeling.




Figure 1: Direction Trajectories across CVPR+ICLR+NeurIPS — ALL CATEGORIES (direct
labels). Each curve is the yearly aggregated TF–IDF mass for a direction (integer year ticks).

   The consolidated view highlights three macro patterns: (i) a sharp takeoff of VLM/LLM ; (ii) sustained
growth of Generative Model, with increasing integration into perception pipelines; and (iii) steady increases
in Video Understanding and stable but reconfigured 3D Reconstruction trajectories.
   Fig.2 presents small-multiple line charts in which each panel corresponds to a research direction. The
horizontal axis shows years (2022–2025) and the vertical axis shows the fraction of all papers attributed to


                                                     2
that direction. Because each panel has its own vertical scale, comparisons should be made within a panel
across years rather than across panels by absolute height. Two global trends stand out: (i) generative and
multimodal areas expand steadily and spill over into 3D, video, and editing; and (ii) several classical learning
paradigms (e.g., self-supervised, meta-learning, GNNs, weak supervision) decline or plateau in relative share,
while “engineering and safety” themes such as efficiency, robustness, and privacy diffuse across the field.




Figure 2: Small-multiples view of research-direction trajectories from 2022–2025. Each panel
shows one category; the x-axis is year and the y-axis is normalized topic intensity (aggregated TF–IDF
score). Vision–Language/Multimodal/LLM, Diffusion & Generative, and NeRF/Neural Rendering trend
upward, while some traditional areas (e.g., 2D Object Detection, Self-Supervised/Pretraining) soften; others
(e.g., GNN, Bayesian, Optimization) remain flat or decline slightly.

    Generative and multimodal topics show the most pronounced rise. Diffusion and generative methods
increase year over year, indicating that content generation continues to drive both methodological and
application-level innovation. In parallel, vision–language and broader multimodal directions grow rapidly,
reflecting the consolidation of large models and cross-modal alignment as core infrastructure. Closely related
3D content representations also climb: Gaussian splatting and neural rendering trend upward, as do 3D ge-
ometry, multiview, and reconstruction, signaling a shift from recognition alone toward high-fidelity synthesis
and editable 3D assets.
    Structure-aware 3D understanding strengthens as well. After an early dip, point-cloud processing re-
bounds slightly, while mesh and surface modeling rise steadily, suggesting interest in controllable, constraint-
aware geometry. 3D detection and segmentation fluctuate: 3D detection peaks mid-period and then recedes,
and 2D segmentation dips and recovers in the latest year. These oscillations likely reflect evolving bench-
marks, task boundaries, and downstream deployment needs.


                                                       3
    Temporal perception and human-centric understanding gain traction. Video understanding climbs from
a low baseline, and tracking, flow, and re-identification increase gradually. Pose, face, and full-body analysis
accelerate in the last two years, underscoring the move toward agent- and human-centered applications.
Open-vocabulary grounding continues to rise, indicating that zero-shot recognition with language priors is
becoming a standard capability.
    Some “inner-loop” methodology themes cool or integrate into larger systems. Self-supervised pretraining
peaks around 2023 and then declines, consistent with the field’s pivot to adapting foundation models rather
than foregrounding self-supervision as a standalone contribution. Meta-learning and AutoML, weak/semi-
/few-shot learning, GNNs, and causality/treatment-effect topics trend downward or remain choppy, sug-
gesting these ideas increasingly appear as modules within broader pipelines rather than as primary focal
points. Optimization and theory also edge downward, possibly due to attention shifting toward system-level
integration and empirical capability building.
    Engineering and reliability concerns become more visible. Efficiency, compression, and acceleration surge
in the most recent year, while robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, uncertainty, and safety show
steady growth. Privacy, watermarking, copyright, and fairness recede from a prior peak but maintain a
notable presence, indicating that trust and governance have normalized rather than vanished. Interpretability
rebounds after a dip, and federated and distributed learning stabilize after an earlier high, reflecting the
ongoing importance of multi-institution collaboration and data-side constraints in real deployments.
    Application-oriented areas display differentiated momentum. Medical and biological imaging rise consis-
tently. Scene graphs, human–object interaction, and affordances strengthen recently, marking a shift from
static recognition to interaction-ready understanding. Restoration, super-resolution, and enhancement track
upward steadily; autonomous driving is broadly stable with a slight increase; and remote sensing maintains
a modest uptick. Time-series, sequential modeling, and state-space approaches reach a high around 2024
and soften thereafter, consistent with their absorption into the foundation-model toolkit. Active learning
and data selection pick up in the latest year, highlighting renewed attention to data efficiency and dataset
governance.
    Overall, Fig.2 depicts an ongoing transition toward “multimodal generative foundations plus 3D percep-
tion and editing,” while traditional paradigm-centric methods recede as independent flags and reappear as
components inside larger systems. Simultaneously, scaling-aware and safety-oriented concerns grow in promi-
nence, pushing research toward solutions that are efficient, robust, and compliant. For problem selection, the
curves encourage emphasis on cross-modal, 3D, and video settings anchored in human-centric tasks, together
with system designs that explicitly target efficiency, reliability, and data governance.
    In Fig 3, across all venues, Vision–Language/Multimodal/LLM exhibits the steepest increase, followed
by Diffusion & Generative. Video Understanding and human-centric topics rise as well, while 3D-related
areas (3D Geometry; NeRF/Gaussian Splatting) continue to gain but at a slower rate.


4     Vision–Language and LLMs
Executive summary. Across CVPR/NeurIPS/ICLR (2023–2025), VLM abstracts pivot from ground-
ing/referring toward instruction following and reasoning. Parameter-efficient adaptation (adapters/LoRA)
and prompt-style mechanisms remain common. Training is dominated by pretrain + finetune, with a clear
rise in instruction tuning. Loss design shifts away from purely contrastive objectives toward mixtures that
include KL/distillation and cross-entropy/ranking. Explicit dataset name mentions become rarer in ab-
stracts (COCO/ImageNet steadily decline). Co-mentioned modalities tilt toward 3D and depth, while audio
stabilizes and begins to recover in 2025.

4.1    Models (named backbones & families)
ALIGN [4] remains the single most cited family in VLM abstracts (≈ 5.8% in 2024, dipping slightly to 5.1%
in 2025). LLaVA [3] shows the fastest growth (0.1% → 1.2% → 2.7%), mirroring the community’s shift to
instruction-following VLMs. Classical backbones shrink in visibility—ResNet/ConvNeXt [5, 6] and ViT [7]
roughly halve by 2025. MoE [8] references roughly double by 2025, indicating increasing interest in expert
routing for multimodal scaling.

    ALIGN [4] (“A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-text embedding”) scales contrastive dual-encoder pretraining
to over one billion noisy image–alt-text pairs, deliberately avoiding heavy curation and showing that scale
can compensate for label noise. A vision encoder and a text encoder are trained with a contrastive objective
to align representations in a shared space, enabling strong zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval
without task-specific heads. The paper emphasizes that simple frequency filtering plus large scale suffices to
surpass more complex cross-attention models on Flickr30k/MSCOCO retrieval.
    CLIP [1] learns image–text alignment using a dual-encoder (image transformer/CNN + text transformer)
trained with InfoNCE-style contrastive loss on hundreds of millions of web pairs, producing a universal
embedding space for zero-shot recognition and robust transfer. CLIP commonly serves as the frozen vision
encoder in later LVLMs. (For scale context, BLIP reports the CLIP baseline trained on ~400M pairs in its
retrieval comparison table.)
    BLIP [2] (“Bootstrapping Language–Image Pretraining”) introduces a Multimodal Mixture of Encoder–Decoder
(MED) that can act as (i) unimodal encoders for ITC, (ii) an image-grounded text encoder for ITM, and (iii)
an image-grounded text decoder for language modeling—jointly optimizing ITC, ITM, and LM to support
both understanding and generation. BLIP also proposes CapFilt (captioning & filtering) to bootstrap cleaner
pretraining data from noisy web alt-text, improving retrieval, captioning, and VQA across 14M–129M images
and scaling to partially include LAION.
    Flamingo [12] is an LVLM that conditions a large decoder-only LLM on visual evidence via gated
cross-attention layers. A lightweight Perceiver-Resampler compresses image/video features into a small
set of tokens fed into the language model, enabling few-shot multimodal learning on interleaved image–text
streams. The work highlights training on a mixture of web corpora with interleaved modalities (e.g., M3W )
to yield strong few-shot and zero-shot VQA/retrieval.

    LLaVA [3] (“Large Language-and-Vision Assistant”) shows that visual instruction tuning—supervising
an LLM with high-quality, GPT-4 generated multimodal conversations paired with images—can endow the
model with broad instruction following, reasoning, and perception skills. A simple projection bridge maps
image features from a CLIP-like encoder into the LLM token space, after which stage-wise tuning on the
synthetic conversations yields strong zero-shot generalization.
    DINO [34] demonstrates that self-distillation without labels (student–teacher with momentum) applied to
Vision Transformers yields emergent patch-level correspondences and high-quality features for downstream
tasks; key ingredients are multi-crop augmentations and centering strategies that stabilize training. DINO
is often used as an initialization or backbone in vision systems. DINOv2 [35] scales this recipe substan-
tially: it trains larger ViT backbones on a carefully curated, de-duplicated image corpus, strengthens the
teacher–student alignment with improved regularization and prototype objectives, and targets resolution-
robust, task-agnostic features. As a result, DINOv2 delivers strong zero-/few-shot transfer and competitive
dense recognition performance without labels, making it a common visual encoder for VLMs and robotics
pipelines. DINOv3 [36] further advances self-supervised ViTs by (i) scaling both data and model size with
careful data preparation/optimization, (ii) introducing Gram anchoring to prevent degradation of dense
feature maps under long schedules, and (iii) applying post-hoc strategies that improve flexibility across in-
put resolution, model size, and even text-alignment. The released DINOv3 suite yields high-quality dense
features and outperforms prior self-/weakly-supervised visual foundation models across a broad range of
tasks.
    Grounding DINO [13] marries DINO-style detectors with open-vocabulary pretraining, aligning region-level
visual features with free-form text so that one detector handles both traditional object categories and arbi-
trary phrases (e.g., referring expressions) in a single pipeline. The method leverages region–text pretraining
and phrase grounding signals to enable open-set detection.
    MoE [8] architectures (e.g., Switch Transformers) insert a sparse gating mechanism that routes each token
to a small subset of specialized expert MLPs, achieving parameter-efficient scaling to hundreds of billions
or trillion-parameter regimes while keeping per-token compute roughly constant. Such sparse decoders
increasingly serve as the language backbone in LVLMs.
   Overall, across these families, two design templates dominate: dual-encoder contrastive pretraining
(ALIGN/CLIP) for universal embeddings, and LLM-centric conditioning with cross-attention and instruction
tuning (Flamingo/LLaVA). BLIP bridges understanding–generation with its MED and data bootstrapping,
while DINO and Grounding-DINO provide strong vision backbones and open-vocabulary grounding that
LVLMs can exploit.
    In Table 2, Dual-Encoder families (ALIGN/CLIP) emphasize dataset scale and a contrastive recipe
for broad transfer. LVLM families (Flamingo/LLaVA) inject vision into a powerful language decoder via

cross-attention or a simple projector, and then rely on instruction-like supervision to elicit rea-
soning/grounding. BLIP occupies the middle ground by unifying ITC/ITM/LM and bootstrapping
cleaner captions. DINO and Grounding DINO secure the vision side—self-supervised features and
open-vocabulary localization—that downstream LVLMs frequently build upon. Finally, MoE provides a
path to scale language backbones with sparse compute, increasingly common in recent LVLMs.

4.2    Fusion / Architectural Integration
Table 3 summarizes how VLM papers integrate vision and language components. We observe three clear
movements.
    Lightweight promptization rises. Prompt/Prefix tuning is the most frequently referenced mechanism and
continues to trend upward (13.0,→,16.4,→,14.3%, Trend +1.3,pp; Slope +3.43,pp/yr), reflecting a preference
for parameter-efficient adaptation on strong frozen backbones [37, 38]. Adapter/LoRA usage also grows
steadily (1.3,→,4.0,→,4.1%, Trend +2.8,pp), consistent with the widespread adoption of low-rank updates
for multimodal fine-tuning [39].
    Bridging modules remain active while “heavy” fusion softens. Cross-/co-attention stays stable to slightly
positive (Trend +0.5,pp), often appearing in systems that inject visual features into frozen LMs (e.g.,
Flamingo-style cross-attention layers) [12]. Projector/MLP heads increase (Trend +0.6,pp), consistent with
simple alignment layers that map modality embeddings into a shared space (as in CLIP-style dual encoders
with learned projections) [1]. The Q-Former bridge (BLIP-2) stays non-negligible and flat (Trend +0.0,pp),
suggesting continued but specialized use where learned query tokens are advantageous [9].
    Architecture choices rebalance. Mixture-of-Experts/gating is mildly up (Trend +0.8,pp), indicating ex-
ploratory interest in sparse capacity [40]. By contrast, encoder–decoder patterns show a small net decline
(Trend −1.3,pp), despite remaining important for generation-centric systems (e.g., OFA, PaLI) [41, 21].
Dual-encoder/two-tower usage edges downward (Trend −0.1,pp), likely reflecting a shift from pure re-
trieval/contrastive training toward instruction-following and generative pipelines where cross-attention or

bridging modules provide tighter fusion.
   Overall, the field is converging on parameter-efficient tuning + light bridging as default design knobs (for
cost, stability, and reusability), while reserving cross-attention/Q-Former for cases that require stronger,
token-level conditioning. Sparse MoE appears as an emerging capacity-scaling option, whereas monolithic
encoder–decoder and pure dual-encoder designs, though still influential, grow more selectively applied.

4.3    Tasks
Table 4 profiles how task emphases have evolved in recent VLM work (shares over 2023–2025). We see
a decisive pivot toward instruction-following and multi-step reasoning, alongside a broad cooling of classic
grounding/captioning style tasks.
   Reasoning / Instruction: The fastest-growing stratum rises from 13.5% to 25.0% (Trend +11.5,pp; Slope
+5.71,pp/yr), driven by instruction-tuned LMMs that attach visual adapters to frozen (or lightly fine-tuned)
LMs and are optimized with conversation-style data (e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT-4) [3, 22, 25].
These systems prioritize chain-of-thought localization, tool-use hooks, and preference optimization, naturally
expanding the proportion of “reasoning” papers.
   Grounding / Referring: Once dominant, this stratum declines by 13.0,pp overall, reflecting a shift from
RefCOCO/phrase-grounding formulations toward instruction-following stacks where grounding appears as a

sub-capability rather than the end task. Methodologically, open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., GLIP, Ground-
ingDINO) remain key components but are now more often embedded as plug-ins [10, 13].
    Retrieval: The share is broadly stable (8.5,→,8.3%), consistent with the continued role of dual-encoders
for retrieval and RAG back-ends (CLIP-style alignment; BLIP/OFA hybrids for generative read-out) [1, 2,
41].
    Captioning and VQA: Generic image captioning declines modestly (−1.9,pp), likely absorbed by instruction-
chat settings where captioning becomes an intermediate capability [2]. VQA dips slightly (−0.5,pp), as com-
munity benchmarks (e.g., VQA v2, GQA) give way to broader multimodal instruction suites; nonetheless
VQA remains a standard probe for perception-reasoning coupling [42, 43].
    Video QA / Captioning: The slice is nearly flat, indicating steady but not explosive growth. While
datasets such as MSRVTT-QA and NExT-QA continue to anchor evaluation, compute/data cost keeps
video tasks a smaller share relative to image-centric reasoning [44, 45].
    OCR / Text recognition: The share is small but persistent (roughly 1%), reflecting increased demand for
document-centric VLMs (e.g., TrOCR/Donut lines) and the prevalence of text-rich scenes within instruction
datasets [46, 47].
    Open-vocabulary detection / segmentation: A gradual decline (−1.0,pp) likely reflects consolidation:
many recent LMMs use open-vocab perception as a front-end (OWL-ViT/ViLD/SAM/OpenSeg families)
rather than publishing it as a standalone task [48, 49, 50, 51].
    Overall, the center of gravity is moving from task-specific supervision (grounding, captioning) toward
generalist, instruction-tuned reasoning with retrieval and open-vocab perception as composable sub-systems.
This aligns with the design trend noted in Sec. 4.2: lightweight adaptation of powerful frozen LMs plus
modular visual front-ends.

4.4    Training Paradigms
Table 5 tracks the training regimes emphasized in recent VLM papers (2023–2025). We observe a decisive
shift toward fine-tuning strong pretrained components with parameter-efficient knobs and instruction data,
while earlier web-scale weak/ self-supervision plays a relatively smaller role in new papers.


                          Table 5: Training paradigms appearing in VLM papers.

                  Instruction Tuning      1.1% 4.2% 5.0% +3.9%                        1.75

                  Multi-task/Curriculum 2.6% 1.6% 1.9% −0.8%                         −0.08

    Pretrain + Finetune: This remains the anchor recipe and grows by +5.2 pp overall. Typical patterns
couple a frozen or lightly finetuned LM with an image encoder that was pretrained via contrastive/web
supervision (e.g., CLIP/ALIGN), then finetune end-to-end or at the bridge for downstream tasks [1, 4, 2].
    Prompt / Prefix: Promptization rises (+1.3 pp), reflecting the appeal of tuning a small prompt vector
instead of full weights for new domains or tasks [37, 38]. In multimodal stacks this often means learning
visual prompts or cross-modal prompts while keeping the LM mostly frozen.
    Instruction Tuning: A substantial increase (+3.9 pp) mirrors the community pivot to conversational
VLMs: systems such as LLaVA and InstructBLIP attach vision adapters and then perform supervised
instruction tuning on (often synthetic) multimodal dialogues [3, 22]. This training style turns caption-
ing/grounding capabilities into general instruction following.
    LoRA / Adapters: Parameter-efficient updates expand (+2.8 pp), driven by their low compute/VRAM
cost and stability when merging or stacking skills across domains [39, 52]. In practice, many VLMs combine
LoRA with instruction tuning.
    Self- / Weak- / Semi-supervision: The share decreases (−6.1 pp). While self/weak supervision (e.g.,
SimCLR, MoCo; large-scale noisy web pairs as in ALIGN/CLIP) remains crucial for pretraining encoders,
new papers increasingly take such backbones as given and focus on finetuning/instruction stages instead [53,
54, 1, 4, 55].
    Distillation: Usage is relatively steady (net −0.4 pp; slight positive slope), often appearing to compress
vision encoders, align modality bridges, or transfer reasoning supervision from stronger teachers into smaller
student LMMs [56, 2].
    Multi-task / Curriculum: A small decline (−0.8 pp) likely reflects consolidation: unified instruction
tuning increasingly subsumes the benefits of multi-task/curriculum training observed in earlier generalist
frameworks such as OFA/PaLI and instruction-style curricula (FLAN) [41, 21, 57].
    Overall, the center of gravity moves from building encoders with massive weak supervision to adapting
those encoders (and frozen LMs) with instruction data and parameter-efficient updates. This reduces cost,
speeds iteration, and aligns with the modular fusion trends in Sec. 4.2.

4.5    Loss Families
Table 6 summarizes the loss objectives most commonly reported in VLM papers from 2023–2025. We observe
a rebalancing from pretraining-style contrastive objectives toward alignment, supervision, and compression
losses that better fit instruction-tuned, generation-oriented pipelines.
    Contrastive / InfoNCE: The share of contrastive learning drops markedly (−5.7 pp; slope −2.07 pp/yr).
This mirrors a shift in new works away from building image–text encoders from scratch (as in CLIP/ALIGN)
toward adapting such pretrained encoders and coupling them with large LMs. Contrastive learning remains

foundational for representation learning and retrieval [58, 53, 1], but appears less frequently as the primary
objective in papers that focus on multimodal instruction following.
    KL / Distillation: A small net increase (+0.3 pp) reflects steady use of Kullback–Leibler–based distillation
to compress vision backbones, align vision–language bridges, or transfer reasoning signals from stronger
LMM teachers to lighter students [56, 2]. Distillation is often combined with supervised instruction losses
to stabilize training.
    Triplet / Ranking: This family remains low and stable. Triplet and margin-based ranking continue
to appear in retrieval and grounding submodules, but are less central when the end task is dialogue-style
generation [59].
    Cross-Entropy / Focal: Classification-style objectives are modestly represented. They are widely used
for detector heads or token-level supervision in bridging modules; focal loss is occasionally adopted for
long-tail/open-vocabulary settings [60].
    MSE / L1 / L2: Regression losses persist at a low but steady rate, mainly for projector heads, align-
ment regressors, or value heads in reward/prefence optimization stages. Their prevalence is limited by the
dominance of token-level cross-entropy in instruction tuning.
    Dice / IoU: These segmentation-oriented objectives shrink slightly as standalone open-vocabulary per-
ception becomes a plug-in capability, rather than a primary contribution in VLM papers [61, 62].
    Chamfer / EMD: Point-set distances (Chamfer, Earth Mover’s) are niche in mainstream VLM work and
mostly appear in papers that also target 3D grounding or generative geometry, where set/shape supervision
is required [63].
    Overall, compared to 2023, losses in 2025 VLM papers reflect a community focus on instruction-tuned
generation with modular perception: contrastive losses are still crucial for encoders and retrieval, but many
new contributions emphasize KL-based distillation and CE-style supervision layered on top of pretrained
backbones and LMs.

4.6    Datasets
Table 7 lists curated datasets that authors explicitly mention in VLM abstracts. We caution that abstracts
under-report training data, especially for recent generalist LMMs that rely on mixtures of private or fil-
tered corpora. Even with that caveat, three patterns emerge. First, legacy caption benchmarks such as
MS-COCO [64, 65] and ImageNet [66] decline steadily in mentions (COCO: −3.0 pp; ImageNet: −1.5 pp).
They remain common for sanity checks and zero-shot probes, but fewer new papers position them as primary
contributions. Second, the share of open-web sources is small but persistent: LAION [67, 68] stays roughly
flat overall, consistent with a trend where authors reference large web datasets generically while focusing
the abstract on downstream instruction tuning. Third, task-specific datasets shrink or stabilize, reflecting a
shift toward instruction-chat evaluations where many traditional tasks appear as sub-skills rather than end-
points. RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg for referring expressions [69, 70], Flickr30k for captioning [71],
CC3M/CC12M for web-scale caption pretraining [72, 73], VQA-v2 and OK-VQA for QA and knowledge-
augmented QA [42, 74], WebVid/MSR-VTT/MSVD for video-text pairs [75, 76, 77], YouCook2/HowTo100M
for instructional video grounding [78, 79], and Visual Genome for dense region-language grounding [80] all
show flat to negative trends in abstract mentions.

    Overall, abstracts increasingly de-emphasize named, single-dataset training and emphasize model behav-
ior on multi-task, instruction-style suites. This aligns with the broader movement in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 to-
ward reusing strong pretrained encoders, lightweight adaptation, and instruction tuning, with classic datasets
retained primarily for probing, ablations, and comparability.

4.7    Modalities (co-mentioned with VLM)
Table 8 tracks which additional modalities are co-mentioned alongside vision–language modeling in 2023–2025
abstracts. Three observations emerge. First, 3D/point–cloud signals tick upward overall (Trend +0.7 pp),
echoing growing interest in grounding LMMs to embodied/3D settings (robotics, digital twins, scene under-
standing). Much of this activity aligns features across modalities rather than building fully new architectures,
e.g., shared embedding spaces that can accept RGB, depth, audio, IMU, or 3D point inputs as in ImageBind’s
multi-sense alignment [81]. Second, classic image–text mentions decline (−3.5 pp), consistent with a shift
from single-pair supervision toward broader instruction-style training where images appear interleaved with
other cues (video frames, depth maps, layout, etc.). Depth/RGB-D is roughly steady to slightly positive
(−0.2 pp net but a small positive slope), reflecting practical pipelines that fuse RGB with monocular or
sensor depth for perception and 3D reasoning, again typically through lightweight adapters or shared-token
bridges rather than bespoke RGB-D encoders. Third, audio/speech and video–text show modest declines
(−1.4 pp and −1.1 pp, respectively). These modalities remain active, but many new papers focus on general-
ist instruction-following while citing prior audio/video-capable foundations instead of proposing stand-alone
audio- or video-specific objectives; e.g., Flamingo-style cross-attention handles interleaved frames and ex-
tends naturally to audio features when available [12].


                          Table 8: Additional modalities co-mentioned in VLM papers.
                      Item                 2023    2024       2025   Trend Slope (pp/yr)
                      3D/Point Cloud 10.7% 11.7% 11.4% +0.7%                        0.71
                      Image-Text      8.6% 6.2% 5.1% −3.5%                         −0.42
                      Depth/RGB-D     4.7% 4.1% 4.6% −0.2%                          0.22
                      Audio/Speech    5.4% 3.5% 4.0% −1.4%                         −0.99
                      Video-Text      2.7% 1.5% 1.6% −1.1%                         −0.31

   Overall, the co-mention trends suggest a pragmatic strategy: reuse strong image–text roots and attach
additional modalities via alignment or prompting, reserving heavy bespoke modeling only where task benefits



                                                         12
are clear (e.g., robotics 3D grounding or long-horizon video understanding). This is consistent with the
broader design and training shifts reported in Sections 4.2 and 4.4.

Takeaways for readers about VLMs. (1) If your problem can be framed as instruction or reasoning, em-
phasize it in the title/abstract to align with the strongest tailwinds. (2) Parameter-efficient adapters/LoRA
and prompt-style interfaces have become lingua franca—treat them as strong baselines or ablations. (3)
When contrastive pretraining is not the core contribution, keep it minimal and focus on downstream instruc-
tion/finetuning strategy and broad evaluation. (4) Explicit dataset name-dropping is rarely needed unless
the dataset itself is a contribution; for video/3D, clarifying scale and diversity is more informative. (5) If
you use 3D/depth/audio, state it early; cross-modal grounding is increasingly valued.


5    Cross-venue Comparison and Practical Advice
Cross-venue comparison. CVPR retains the strongest 3D emphasis (e.g., 23.1% of 2025 CVPR abstracts
mention 3D geometry vs. 7.8% at ICLR), while ICLR has the largest 2025 VLM share (40.7%, comparable to
CVPR’s 39.5%). CVPR sees the highest diffusion share in 2025 (25.7%) among the three. NeurIPS—available
up to 2024 in our data—shows an early VLM ramp (30.5% in 2024) with diffusion at 11.6%.

Actionable advice for readers. (1) Connect perception with VLMs. Successful 2025 papers increasingly
formulate classic vision problems (detection, segmentation, tracking) as instruction-following, grounding, or
tool-using tasks on top of pretrained multimodal backbones. Designing lean projectors/adapters and strong
data recipes (instruction or preference alignment) is impactful. (2) Make generative tools usable. If diffu-
sion is part of the pipeline, emphasize controllability, speed/distillation, and reliability; benchmarks with
precise quality/latency trade-offs resonate with current trends. (3) Think long-context and video. Methods
that scale to minute- or hour-long sequences while preserving reasoning ability and memory efficiency are
rising. (4) Be explicit about efficiency and safety. Lightweight inference, sparsity, cache-aware design, and
safety/robustness concerns are common acceptance signals across venues.


6    Limitations
Our pipeline is lexicon-driven on abstracts only. Some fields (e.g., datasets, losses) are systematically
under-reported in abstracts; therefore the absolute numbers are conservative. Papers may be multi-label;
percentages are fractions of all papers per year, not summing to 100%. Nonetheless, the main trends (VLM
ascent, diffusion pragmatization, steady 3D, rising video) are robust across venues and years.


7    Conclusion
We provide a transparent, replicable measurement of what the community has worked on in 2023–2025. By
2025, multimodal VLMs have become the organizing center for a large portion of accepted papers; diffusion
matured into controllable, accelerated modules; and 3D and video remain vibrant with more cross-modal
formulations. We release the full lexicon and code (in the conversation history) to encourage reproducibility
and extension to other venues/years.
